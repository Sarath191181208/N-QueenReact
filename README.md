# N Queen Problem Visualization

**N Queen using backtracking** is a popular in which you have to arrange the queens in a NxN grid without them attacking each other.
A more specific version of this problem called 8queens problem is given below:

## Description

I am using **functional components & react hooks** to handle the events from the user.
List of Hooks used:

- useState.
- useEffect.
- useCallback.
- useRef.

Learn About Hooks here:

- [React Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html)

The Animation is done using [setTimeout](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_settimeout.asp) in a recursive fashion for the animation. In every step of recursion we get the next step of the algorithm.
The algorithm is precomputed for extensibility and is stored in a [Linked list](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/implementation-linkedlist-javascript/).
For every recursive call the Linked List is iterated thus showing the animation.
